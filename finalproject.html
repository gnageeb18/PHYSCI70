<h3 style="color:black;"> My Final Project Ideas!</h3>
<p> I am deciding what I want to work on for my final project. As of right now I have 3 ideas:

<br> <br>
(1) Heart Valve Bioreactor: A bioreactor mechanism composed of a ventricular and aortic component used for conditioning
and testing of tissue engineered heart valve. This would be composed of a ventricular chanber, valve chamber, and aortic compliance chamber.
It would also comprise a closed flow loop with a media reservoir.

(2) Secret Bookshelf Door: Inspired by the Dark Knight Triology,this project would involve making a bookshelf that is secretly
a door to my secret lair. While the lair will not be included in this project, the door is a good start!
